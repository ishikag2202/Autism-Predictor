# Autism-Predictor

##Introduction
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects how a person communicates, interacts, and behaves. Early detection plays a critical role in providing timely support and improving long-term outcomes.

This project is a machine learning-based web application built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of ASD in individuals using a simple screening questionnaire and personal information. The app leverages supervised learning models—Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost—trained on Kaggle dataset. Among these, Random Forest showed the highest accuracy and was chosen for final predictions.

The application offers a simple, accessible interface where users can enter inputs, receive instant predictions, and even generate PDF reports. It highlights how technology can assist in creating accessible, early-stage screening solutions for health-related assessments.
